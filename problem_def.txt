Define problem:


We have a number of teams, each with a some workers within. They are moving to a new building with many neighbourhoods. Given some weights between teams how do we optimise where they sit?


Simplifications:
Within a neighbourhood we assume no distance between workers. So we should never consider movements within a neighbourhood. 
The distance between workers in different neighbourhoods is the taken as the distance between the centers of the neighbourhoods.
Distance is calculated as the dX + dY, we dont try and go diagonally.

Cost function:
Sum(distance*weight) between all combinations of workers

Toy example:

6 Neighbourhoods, holding 20 workers each.
4 Teams with t1 = 50, t2 = 30, t3 = 20 and t4 = 10
Weights between teams:
t1,t3 = high
t1,t4 = low
t2,t3 = high
t3,t4 = low

Also people within team that are in different neighbourhoods has a super high weight.
